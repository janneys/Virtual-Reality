Quantifying Immersion in Virtual Reality

For many years, scientists keep exploring techniques for evaluating and improving immersion in visual environment and trying to prove the visual reality has practical meaning through different kinds of experiments. In the paper ‘Quantifying Immersion in Virtual Reality’ [1], the author Pausch et al. compared the performance of nding an object in a scene with the best possible VR device and desktop interfaces. They found that users with a VR interface complete a search task faster than users with a stationary monitor and a hand-based input device. What’s more, there’s a positive transfer of training from VR to stationary displays and a negative transfer of training from stationary displays to VR.

In this project, we testify the results in Pausch’s work with a virtual room created by Unity3D and do similar experiment as Pausch’s using modern VR device Oculus Rift. After analysing the data we got from experiment, we get our conclusion which is not totally the same as Pausch’s conclusion.
